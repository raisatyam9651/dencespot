        <p class="body-l">She returned to India and established DenceSpot in Gurugram, structuring it around a principle that sounds obvious and is surprisingly rare: the doctor who assesses a case designs it and performs it. Patients are not consulted by one person, sold to by another and operated on by a technician they meet on the day.</p>
        <p class="body-l">Her clinical interest is in the part of hair restoration that does not photograph well — donor management, staging over a patient's lifetime, and recognising the cases where surgery is the wrong answer. A hairline that looks excellent at thirty and cannot be maintained at forty-five is a planning failure, not a surgical one.</p>
