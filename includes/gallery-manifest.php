/**
 * Explicit media manifest — the single source of truth for what every image in
 * assets/img/gallery/ actually is.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Both /gallery and /hair-transplant-results-gurgaon
 * previously built their image lists by scanning the directory and guessing the
 * category from the filename, defaulting anything unrecognised to "patient
 * before/after result". Audited on 1 Sep 2026, that default had swept up:
 *
 *   • 3 NABH certificate images, and
 *   • 12 marketing creatives belonging to GROWIG HAIR SOLUTION, an unrelated
 *     hair-patch brand in Dwarka,
 *
 * and published all 15 as consented DenceSpot patient results, each with an
 * ImageObject node in JSON-LD. On a YMYL medical page that is a
 * misrepresentation in structured data and a medical-advertising problem, not a
 * cosmetic bug.
 *
 * TWO RULES, NOT NEGOTIABLE:
 *   1. Never rebuild this list from a directory listing. A filename is not a
 *      consent record. A new file dropped into the folder must stay invisible
 *      until someone adds it here deliberately.
 *   2. Only CAT_RESULT earns ImageObject schema. Everything else is either
 *      chrome or withheld.
 *
 * Consent: the clinic confirmed on 1 Sep 2026 that written consent is on file
 * for the patient photographs in this folder.
 *
 * ⚠ Consent is not the only test. Several files the clinic consented to are
 * still withheld below because they are not what they would have been labelled
 * as — a facial PRP case, an intra-operative close-up, two duplicates of the
 * named cases, and single post-op frames with no before. Consent settles
 * whether an image MAY be published; it does not settle what it SHOWS.
 *
 * ⚠ Several published composites carry the patient full name and surgery date
 * burnt into the image, beside an unobscured face. That is the clinic to weigh,
 * not the template: raise it before the next deploy.

 * Every image in assets/img/gallery/, classified.

 * watermark, phone number and domain burnt in. They are rendered as ONE image,
 * never split and never rendered into a two-slot before/after card — halving
 * them would cut through the baked-in "BEFORE"/"AFTER" labels.
 *
 * Per-case technique, graft count and review interval are deliberately absent.
 * The clinic has not supplied them, and the templates omit an unknown field
 * rather than printing a placeholder into a patient-facing caption.
