$faqs = [
    ['q' => 'How much hair fall is normal?',
     'a' => 'Shedding somewhere in the region of 50 to 100 hairs a day is generally considered normal, and it varies with washing frequency, season and hair length. What matters clinically is not the count but the trend: hair that is coming out faster than it is being replaced, a parting that is widening, or a scalp that is becoming visible. Those are worth examining.'],
    ['q' => 'When should I see a doctor about hair fall?',
     'a' => 'When shedding has been heavier than usual for more than about six to eight weeks, when the pattern is changing, when patches appear, or when the scalp is itchy, flaking or sore. Earlier is better — treatment holds what you still have far more reliably than it recovers what has gone.'],
    ['q' => 'What tests are done for hair fall?',
     'a' => 'Examination and scalp magnification first, then blood investigations where indicated — commonly thyroid function, iron studies including ferritin, vitamin D, and a full blood count. In some cases hormonal tests are added. The point is to identify anything reversible before committing you to long-term treatment.'],
    ['q' => 'Can hair fall be reversed?',
     'a' => 'It depends entirely on the cause. Shedding from a nutritional deficiency, a thyroid problem or telogen effluvium commonly recovers once the cause is corrected. Pattern hair loss is progressive: treatment slows it and can thicken miniaturising hairs, but follicles that are already gone do not come back without surgery.'],
    ['q' => 'Does stress cause hair fall?',
     'a' => 'Significant physical or emotional stress can trigger telogen effluvium, where a large proportion of follicles shift into the shedding phase at once. The shedding typically appears two to three months after the event and usually settles once the trigger has passed. Persistent stress can also worsen an existing pattern.'],
    ['q' => 'What is the difference between hair fall and hair loss?',
     'a' => 'Hair fall usually describes visible shedding — hair on the pillow, in the shower, on the comb. Hair loss describes the net result: less hair than there was. You can shed heavily and keep your density if regrowth keeps pace, and you can lose density with barely any visible shedding. Both are assessed differently.'],
    ['q' => 'Do hair fall shampoos and supplements work?',
     'a' => 'A medicated shampoo genuinely helps a scalp condition such as dandruff or seborrhoeic dermatitis, and correcting a proven deficiency helps. Supplements taken without a deficiency generally do not, and no shampoo treats androgenetic hair loss — the process happens at the follicle, not on the surface.'],
    ['q' => 'Will PRP stop my hair fall?',
     'a' => 'For the right case it can reduce shedding and support thinning follicles, but it does not stop the underlying process and it does nothing where follicles are already gone. It works best alongside medical therapy rather than instead of it. See <a href="/hair-prp-treatment-in-gurgaon">hair PRP treatment</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'When is a hair transplant the answer instead?',
     'a' => 'When follicles in the affected area are already lost, the pattern has stabilised, and the donor area can supply what the plan needs. Where follicles are still present but shrinking, medical treatment and PRP come first — surgery is not a substitute for them. See <a href="/hair-transplant-in-gurgaon">hair transplant in Gurgaon</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'Do I have to take treatment forever?',
     'a' => 'For pattern hair loss, largely yes — treatment holds ground rather than curing the condition, and stopping generally means resuming the loss from where it had reached. For a reversible cause such as iron deficiency or telogen effluvium, treatment is finite. Which situation you are in is exactly what the assessment establishes.'],
    ['q' => 'Is hair fall treatment different for women?',
     'a' => 'The investigation is broader. Female shedding more often has a treatable contributor — thyroid, iron, post-partum change, polycystic ovary syndrome — so those are checked and corrected before anything long-term is started. See <a href="/womens-hair-loss-treatment-in-gurgaon">women’s hair loss treatment</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'How soon will I see results?',
     'a' => 'Hair grows slowly, and every treatment for hair loss is judged in months rather than weeks. Reduced shedding is usually the first change, commonly within two to three months. Visible density change is assessed against baseline photographs from around six months. Anyone promising faster is describing marketing, not biology.'],
