     'a' => 'A treatment in which a small volume of your own blood is spun in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets, and that platelet-rich plasma is injected into the thinning areas of your scalp. The aim is to support follicles that are miniaturising, using growth factors your own platelets carry.'],
    ['q' => 'Does PRP actually work for hair loss?',
     'a' => 'For the right case — early to moderate pattern loss with follicles still present — there is reasonable evidence that PRP can reduce shedding and improve density. The evidence is not uniform, because protocols differ so much between clinics, and a proportion of patients do not respond. It works best as part of a plan alongside medical treatment, not as a substitute for one.'],
    ['q' => 'How many PRP sessions will I need?',
     'a' => 'Most initial courses are planned as three or four sessions about four weeks apart, sometimes more where a larger area is being treated. Maintenance sessions are then commonly spaced every three to six months. Your own number is set after the assessment and confirmed in writing before the first session.'],
    ['q' => 'Is PRP painful?',
     'a' => 'It is uncomfortable rather than painful for most people. The blood draw feels like any blood test; the scalp injections sting briefly, and topical anaesthetic or cooling is used to reduce that. The scalp usually feels tender for a day or so afterwards. Pain tolerance varies.'],
    ['q' => 'How long does one session take?',
     'a' => 'Roughly 30 to 60 minutes from arrival to leaving. Most of that is the blood draw, the spin and preparing the scalp; the injections themselves usually take ten to fifteen minutes. It is a walk-in, walk-out appointment.'],
    ['q' => 'When will I see results from PRP?',
     'a' => 'Reduced shedding is usually the first change people notice, often around six to ten weeks. Changes in texture and density, where they occur, are generally assessed from three to six months against your baseline photographs. Nothing meaningful can be judged after a single session.'],
    ['q' => 'Is PRP permanent, or do I need to keep going?',
     'a' => 'It is not permanent. PRP does not stop the underlying process causing pattern hair loss, so a result is held with maintenance sessions and, in most cases, ongoing medical treatment. If you stop everything, thinning resumes from where it had reached.'],
    ['q' => 'What is the difference between PRP and GFC?',
     'a' => 'Both start from your own blood. PRP injects the platelet-rich plasma itself. GFC breaks the platelets down first so the growth factors are released, then removes the cells, leaving an acellular concentrate. GFC is marketed as a refinement of PRP; its published evidence base is smaller and newer. Neither is automatically the better choice for a given scalp. See our <a href="/prp-vs-gfc-treatment">PRP vs GFC comparison</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'Can PRP regrow hair on a completely bald area?',
     'a' => 'No. PRP acts on follicles that still exist. Where the scalp is fully bald and smooth, or scarred, the follicles are gone and there is nothing for the treatment to support. Those areas are a <a href="/hair-transplant-in-gurgaon">hair transplant</a> question, not a PRP question.'],
    ['q' => 'Is PRP safe? What are the side effects?',
     'a' => 'Because the injected material is made from your own blood, a reaction to the material itself is not expected. The usual effects come from the needles: tenderness, redness, pinpoint marks, mild swelling, occasional headache and bruising at the arm. Infection at an injection site is uncommon but possible, which is why sterile technique and aftercare instructions matter.'],
    ['q' => 'Who should not have PRP?',
     'a' => 'Treatment is usually not offered, or is deferred, with active infection or dermatitis over the injection area, low platelet counts or bleeding disorders, ongoing anticoagulant treatment until reviewed, blood cancers and some other active malignancies, poorly controlled systemic illness, and in pregnancy and breastfeeding. This is not a complete list — suitability is decided at the consultation.'],
    ['q' => 'Can PRP be done after a hair transplant?',
     'a' => 'It is commonly used to support the native hair around a transplanted area, which keeps thinning on its own timetable after surgery. Timing relative to the procedure is decided by the treating doctor, since the scalp needs to have healed first.'],
    ['q' => 'Can women have PRP for hair loss?',
     'a' => 'Yes, and female pattern thinning is one of the more common reasons patients come for it. The order matters, though: thyroid function, iron stores, vitamin D and hormonal causes are checked and treated first, because a proportion of female shedding improves once those are corrected without any injections at all. See <a href="/womens-hair-loss-treatment-in-gurgaon">women’s hair loss treatment</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'Do I need to stop my hair-loss medication during PRP?',
     'a' => 'Usually not — prescribed medical therapy generally continues alongside a PRP course, because the two do different jobs. What does need reviewing before a session is anything affecting clotting, including blood thinners and regular anti-inflammatory painkillers. Bring your full medication list.'],
    ['q' => 'How much does hair PRP treatment cost in Gurgaon?',
     'a' => 'Advertised prices in Gurgaon range widely, because a session is not a standard unit — the volume drawn, the preparation method, the area treated and the number of sessions included all differ. Compare on the course, not the session, and ask what happens if you do not respond. Our pricing is confirmed in writing after the assessment, and our <a href="/prp-hair-treatment-cost-in-gurgaon">PRP cost guide</a> explains what moves the number.'],

        <div class="stack mt-4 measure">
          <p class="body-l">PRP stands for platelet-rich plasma. A small volume of blood is drawn from your arm, exactly as it would be for a routine blood test, and spun in a centrifuge. Spinning separates the blood into layers, and we keep the plasma fraction in which the platelets are concentrated.</p>
          <p class="body-l">That concentrate is injected into the scalp at the depth where hair follicles sit, across the areas that are thinning. Platelets carry growth factors — signalling proteins the body normally uses for repair. The working principle in hair loss is that delivering them around miniaturising follicles helps hold those follicles in their growth phase for longer and improves the blood supply feeding them.</p>
          <p class="body-l">Two things follow from that, and both matter more than any marketing claim. First, PRP acts on follicles that are still alive but shrinking; where a follicle is gone — a fully bald, shiny scalp, or scarred skin — there is nothing left for it to act on. Second, it does not switch off the process driving the hair loss, so a result is maintained rather than banked.</p>
          <p class="body-l">It is also honest to say that the published evidence for PRP in pattern hair loss is supportive but uneven, largely because protocols differ so much between clinics: how the blood is spun, how concentrated the result is, how much is injected and how often. We treat PRP as one part of a plan, not the whole plan.</p>
