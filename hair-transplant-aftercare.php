      <p class="body mt-3">For the first two days, transplanted grafts are held in place by nothing more than early clot formation. They can be dislodged — by a pillow, a towel, a hat pulled off carelessly, or scratching in your sleep. After roughly ten days they are secure and effectively cannot be knocked out. Everything restrictive about early aftercare exists to cover that first window.</p>

Handling is the risk.</p>
          <p class="body-s mt-3">This is also why the first wash is demonstrated rather than described. Reading it and doing it are different things, and the cost of getting it wrong is measured in grafts.</p>

        <p class="meta mt-2">What sheds is the visible hair shaft. The follicle that was transplanted remains in place and enters a resting phase before producing new hair.</p>

        <p class="meta mt-2">This is a normal part of the transplant cycle and happens to the overwhelming majority of patients. Its absence is not better; its presence is not worse.</p>

        <p class="meta mt-2">Surrounding native hair can also shed temporarily from the trauma of surgery. It typically recovers over the following months, and is more noticeable where native coverage was still good.</p>

    <p class="body mt-6" style="color:rgba(255,255,255,.72);max-width:62ch">If you are in week three, looking at hair on your pillow and wondering whether you have wasted your money: this is the expected part. The useful thing to do is photograph it at the same angle each month and bring the photographs to your review.</p>
