     'a' => 'A hair transplant in which each extracted follicular unit is loaded into a fine implanter and placed into the scalp in a single action that creates the site and sets the graft together. Extraction is the same as <a href="/fue-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon">FUE</a>; DHI describes the placement stage.'],
    ['q' => 'What is the real difference between DHI and FUE?',
     'a' => 'Extraction is essentially identical. In FUE all the recipient sites are made first and grafts are then placed into them; in DHI the implanter makes each site and delivers the graft in one motion, setting depth, angle and direction per graft. DHI gives finer control and is slower; FUE placement is more efficient over large areas.'],
    ['q' => 'Is DHI better than FUE?',
     'a' => 'Not universally, and any clinic saying otherwise is selling rather than assessing. DHI has a genuine advantage in hairlines, temples and work between existing hairs. For covering a large crown, conventional FUE placement generally gives the same coverage in less time and at lower cost.'],
    ['q' => 'Does DHI mean I do not have to shave my head?',
     'a' => 'It makes unshaven or partially shaved work easier, which is why it is advertised that way. The donor area still needs trimming so grafts can be extracted accurately, and unshaven work is slower and realistic only for smaller graft numbers. What is possible in your case is decided at consultation.'],
    ['q' => 'What is a &ldquo;DHT hair transplant&rdquo;?',
     'a' => 'A mistake. DHT is dihydrotestosterone, the hormone involved in pattern hair loss — not a surgical technique. Pages advertising a DHT transplant mean DHI, direct hair implantation.'],
    ['q' => 'Does DHI give better graft survival?',
     'a' => 'It is often claimed, on the basis that grafts spend less time outside the body and are handled less. It is a reasonable argument, but the published evidence does not establish DHI as reliably superior to well-executed FUE on survival. Surgeon skill and graft handling matter more than the instrument.'],
    ['q' => 'How many grafts can be done with DHI in one day?',
     'a' => 'Fewer than with conventional FUE placement, because loading implanters one graft at a time is slower. DHI suits defined areas rather than very large multi-zone sessions. Where a big area needs covering, a combined plan is usually the better answer.'],
    ['q' => 'Is DHI painful?',
     'a' => 'The local anaesthetic injections are the uncomfortable part, as with any hair transplant. The placement itself is not typically painful. Soreness and some swelling for a few days afterwards are normal and managed with prescribed medication.'],
    ['q' => 'Does DHI recover faster than FUE?',
     'a' => 'No. The donor is treated the same way, the biology is the same, and the shedding and regrowth phases follow the same course — crusting in the first week or two, shedding within a month, new growth from around three to four months, a fair assessment at ten to twelve.'],
    ['q' => 'Why is DHI more expensive?',
     'a' => 'Chair time and consumables. Each graft is handled and loaded individually, which takes longer, and implanter tips are single-use. You are paying for placement precision, which is worth it in a hairline and often is not across a crown. Our <a href="/hair-transplant-cost-in-gurgaon">hair transplant cost guide</a> sets out what moves the number.'],
    ['q' => 'Can DHI fix a hairline that was done badly elsewhere?',
     'a' => 'Often it can help. Softening a line that was placed too straight or too low, and adding single hairs at the correct angles between existing grafts, is exactly the situation implanter control suits. Sometimes grafts also need removing, which is assessed separately.'],
    ['q' => 'Can women have DHI?',
     'a' => 'Yes, and it is frequently the better choice for women, because the work is usually concentrated along a frontal line or parting and can often be done with minimal trimming. Hormonal, thyroid, iron and post-partum causes are investigated and treated before any surgery is planned.'],
    ['q' => 'How much does DHI cost in Gurgaon?',
     'a' => 'It depends on graft numbers, which zones are treated, whether the whole case is DHI or combined with FUE placement, and the shaving approach. We quote after assessment rather than publishing a headline price, and you get an itemised written estimate before booking.'],
    ['q' => 'What happens at the DHI consultation?',
     'a' => 'History and medication review, scalp and donor examination, pattern staging, photographs for your record, and a written plan — including an honest recommendation on whether DHI, FUE or a combination fits your case, with the cost difference explained.'],

        <p class="eyebrow">The basics, plainly</p>
        <h2 class="h2 mt-2">What Is a DHI Hair Transplant?</h2>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">DHI stands for direct hair implantation. It describes the placement stage of a hair transplant, not the whole procedure. Follicular units are extracted from the donor area exactly as they are in FUE — individually, with a fine punch, leaving dot healing rather than a line.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">The difference comes next. In a conventional FUE, recipient sites are made first across the whole area, and grafts are then placed into those waiting sites. In DHI, each graft is loaded into a hollow implanter — a pen-like instrument with a fine needle tip — and the surgeon makes the site and delivers the graft in one motion. Depth, angle, direction and spacing are all set at that moment, graft by graft.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">Two practical consequences follow. Control is finer, which matters most in the first few rows of a hairline where hairs emerge at very shallow angles and any uniformity reads as artificial. And each graft spends less time outside the body between extraction and placement.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">The trade-off is throughput. Loading implanters one graft at a time is slower than placing into pre-made sites, so DHI generally suits defined areas rather than very large sessions, and it usually costs more per graft. Where a whole crown needs covering, conventional FUE placement is often the better use of both time and money.</p>

    'Why the design matters more than the instrument: an implanter gives you control over the angle of every graft, which is genuinely valuable — and completely wasted behind a hairline drawn in the wrong place. The commonest reason a transplant looks obviously done is not the tool used to place the grafts. It is a line set too low or too straight for the face it sits on, which no amount of precision can rescue later.'

        <h2 class="h2 mt-2">DHI Hair Transplant Cost in Gurgaon</h2>
        <p class="body mt-3 measure">DHI usually carries a higher per-graft rate than conventional FUE, because loading and placing each graft individually takes more chair time and more instruments. Whether that premium is worth paying depends on which zones you are treating — which is a clinical question, not a sales one.</p>

          <div class="card"><p class="h4">Technique mix</p><p class="body-s mt-2">Whole-case DHI or DHI at the front with FUE behind</p></div>
          <div class="card"><p class="h4">Shaving approach</p><p class="body-s mt-2">Unshaven and partial-shave work takes longer</p></div>

        </div>
        <p class="body-s mt-4 measure">Be careful with clinics that price DHI as a premium product and then recommend it for everything. If DHI is the answer to every case regardless of where the loss is, the recommendation is about the price list rather than your scalp. A combined plan — DHI at the front, FUE placement behind — is often the sensible answer and is usually cheaper than either sold whole.</p>
