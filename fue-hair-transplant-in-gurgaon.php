    ['q' => 'What is an FUE hair transplant?',
     'a' => 'A procedure in which follicular units — natural groupings of one to four hairs — are extracted individually from the donor area with a fine punch and placed into thinning or bald areas at the angle and direction the surrounding hair grows. No strip of skin is removed, so there is no linear scar.'],
    ['q' => 'Does FUE leave scars?',
     'a' => 'It leaves many tiny round scars rather than one line — typically pale dots under a millimetre across, spread across the donor area. Spread properly they are difficult to see even at short hair lengths. Clustered extraction, or too many grafts taken from too small an area, is what makes them visible.'],
    ['q' => 'Do I have to shave my whole head for FUE?',
     'a' => 'The donor area is trimmed short so the punch can follow each follicle accurately. Whether the recipient area is trimmed depends on the case and is discussed at consultation. Unshaven and partially shaved approaches exist but suit smaller sessions; they are slower and not appropriate for every plan.'],
    ['q' => 'How many grafts can be done in one FUE session?',
     'a' => 'It depends on your donor supply, scalp laxity and how you tolerate a long day, not on a headline number. Large sessions are possible where the donor genuinely supports them; where it does not, staging across two procedures protects the donor and generally gives a better long-term result.'],
    ['q' => 'Is FUE painful?',
     'a' => 'The local anaesthetic injections are the uncomfortable part. The procedure itself is not typically painful, though it is long. Soreness, tightness or some swelling for a few days afterwards is normal and managed with prescribed medication.'],
    ['q' => 'How long does an FUE procedure take?',
     'a' => 'It scales with graft numbers. Smaller sessions take a few hours; larger ones run through most of the day with breaks for food and rest. It is a day-case procedure and you go home the same day.'],
    ['q' => 'When will transplanted hair start growing?',
     'a' => 'Transplanted hairs commonly shed within the first weeks while the follicles remain in place. New growth usually begins around three to four months, with a fuller picture at roughly ten to twelve months. Growth is uneven early on, which is normal.'],
    ['q' => 'Is FUE permanent?',
     'a' => 'Transplanted follicles keep the characteristics of the donor area and generally persist. Surrounding non-transplanted hair can continue to thin with age, however, which is why a long-term plan and ongoing medical treatment matter. No clinic can guarantee a specific density or a permanent outcome.'],
    ['q' => 'What is over-harvesting, and why does it matter?',
     'a' => 'Taking more grafts from the donor than it can spare, or taking them from too concentrated an area. The donor thins visibly, extraction dots become obvious, and there is no way to reverse it — you cannot put donor hair back. It is the reason a graft number should never be inflated to win a quote.'],
    ['q' => 'FUE or DHI — which is better?',
     'a' => 'Neither is universally better; extraction is essentially the same and the difference is in placement. DHI sets each graft with an implanter in a single action, which suits hairlines and detail zones. FUE placement into pre-made sites is more efficient across large areas. Read more about <a href="/dhi-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon">DHI hair transplant</a>.'],
    ['q' => 'Can I have FUE if I had a strip procedure before?',
     'a' => 'Often yes. An existing <a href="/fut-hair-transplant-in-gurgaon">FUT</a> scar does not rule out FUE, though scalp laxity and the state of the donor need assessing, and grafts can sometimes be taken to camouflage the old scar itself. This is decided on examination.'],
    ['q' => 'Can women have FUE?',
     'a' => 'Sometimes. Female hair loss is more often diffuse, and hormonal, thyroid, iron or post-partum causes need investigating and treating first. Many women do better on medical treatment; surgery is considered selectively, for suitable patterns such as a receding frontal line.'],
    ['q' => 'How much does FUE cost in Gurgaon?',
     'a' => 'Cost depends on graft numbers, donor characteristics, session structure and any supporting treatment, so we quote after assessment rather than publishing a headline price. Our <a href="/hair-transplant-cost-in-gurgaon">hair transplant cost guide</a> explains what moves the number, and you receive an itemised written estimate before booking a date.'],
    ['q' => 'What happens at the FUE consultation?',
     'a' => 'History and medication review, scalp and donor examination with density measurement, pattern staging, photographs for your record, and a written plan covering technique, graft number, timeline and cost factors. Bring your medical history and a list of current medicines.'],

        <h2 class="h2 mt-2">What Is an FUE Hair Transplant?</h2>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">FUE stands for follicular unit extraction. Hair does not grow as single strands but in natural groupings of one to four hairs, called follicular units. In FUE, each of those units is removed from the donor area individually, using a punch typically well under a millimetre across, and every unit leaves a tiny round opening that heals as a pale dot rather than a line.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">Those units are then sorted under magnification, kept in a holding solution, and placed into recipient sites made across the thinning area in the direction and angle the surrounding hair already grows. Once healed they behave exactly like the hair they came from — washed, cut and styled normally.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">The donor area is the whole story. Hair at the back and sides of the scalp is generally resistant to the hormonal process behind pattern loss, which is why it is used, but it is a finite supply that has to last your lifetime. Take too much and the donor thins visibly, which cannot be undone. A responsible plan spends that supply across the areas that matter most to you, in the order that makes sense as the loss progresses.</p>
        <p class="body-l mt-3 measure">This is why nothing sensible can be quoted from a photograph. Two people with identical-looking recession can have completely different donor density, and the plans that follow are not comparable.</p>

    <div class="grid grid--2 mt-6">
      <div class="card card--pad-lg">
        <h3 class="h3">Graft</h3>
        <p class="body mt-3">One follicular unit — a natural grouping that contains anywhere from one to four hairs. It is what gets extracted and what gets placed. It is also the unit almost every clinic prices in.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card card--pad-lg">
        <h3 class="h3">Hair</h3>
        <p class="body mt-3">A single strand. Two thousand grafts might carry anywhere from roughly 4,000 to 5,000 hairs depending on the donor — which is why some clinics quote hair counts instead. The number looks bigger. The transplant is the same size.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Three questions that make quotes comparable</h3>

          <p class="h4">&ldquo;Grafts or hairs?&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="body-s mt-2">If one clinic quotes 4,500 and another 2,000, they may be describing the same procedure. Always ask which unit the number is in.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p class="h4">&ldquo;How was that count arrived at?&rdquo;</p>
          <p class="body-s mt-2">A count should come from a zone-by-zone map of your scalp. A round number offered over the phone is a sales figure, not a plan.</p>
        </div>

          <p class="h4">&ldquo;What is left for later?&rdquo;</p>

    <p class="body-s mt-4 measure">The cheapest per-graft rate applied to an inflated graft count is more expensive than an honest quote, and it costs donor hair you cannot get back. This is the single most useful thing to understand before you speak to any clinic — including this one.</p>

What determines whether you are happy in ten years is whether the donor was read correctly and spent sensibly. Over-harvesting is the one complication that cannot be revised.'
