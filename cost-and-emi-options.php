        <h2 class="h2 mt-2">The Agreement Is With the Lender, Not the Clinic</h2>
        <p class="body mt-3 measure">This is the part most often misunderstood. When you take an instalment plan for a medical procedure, the clinic is paid in full by a finance provider, and you then repay the provider. Your contract is with them.</p>
        <p class="body mt-3 measure">That matters in three practical ways. Interest, tenure and eligibility are set by the provider and cannot be waived by the clinic. Missed payments affect your credit record, not your treatment. And cancelling treatment does not automatically cancel the loan — that has to be resolved with the provider separately.</p>
        <p class="body mt-3 measure">None of this is a reason to avoid EMI. It is a reason to read whose name is on the document before signing it.</p>

          <p class="body-s mt-3"><b>A medical loan</b> is a separate facility from a finance provider, generally allowing longer tenures and larger amounts. It normally involves a credit check and a processing fee.</p>
