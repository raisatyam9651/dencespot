$groups = [
    'Booking and your first visit' => [
        ['q' => 'How do I book a consultation?',
         'a' => 'Use the <a href="/book-consultation">booking page</a>, message the clinic on WhatsApp, or call during opening hours. You give us a name and a phone number, and the clinic calls you back to agree a time. There is no charge to enquire.'],
        ['q' => 'What happens at the first consultation?',
         'a' => 'A medical history and medication review, examination of the scalp and donor area under magnification, staging of your pattern, photographs for your record, and a written plan covering technique, approximate graft number, timeline and cost factors. It is an examination, not a sales meeting.'],
        ['q' => 'What should I bring?',
         'a' => 'Your medical history and a list of any current medicines, including supplements and anything affecting clotting. If you have had a previous procedure elsewhere, bring whatever records or photographs you have. Old photographs of your own hair from a few years ago are genuinely useful.'],
        ['q' => 'Will I be pressured to book on the day?',
         'a' => 'No. You leave with a written plan and a figure, and you decide in your own time. If the honest recommendation is to wait, treat medically first, or do nothing yet, that is what you will be told.'],
        ['q' => 'Can I get an opinion without travelling to the clinic?',
         'a' => 'Send clear photographs on WhatsApp and the clinic will tell you whether a consultation is likely to be worth the journey. What cannot be done remotely is the part that matters — examining the scalp under magnification for miniaturisation, and measuring donor density. No responsible graft number is quoted from a photograph.'],
    ],
    'Cost and payment' => [
        ['q' => 'Why is there no price list on the site?',
         'a' => 'Because a headline figure is almost never what anyone pays. Cost is graft count multiplied by a per-graft rate, and graft count comes from the mapped plan. We publish the factors and the arithmetic instead — see <a href="/hair-transplant-cost-in-gurgaon">how treatment is priced</a>.'],
        ['q' => 'What is included in the estimate?',
         'a' => 'The procedure, local anaesthesia, prescribed post-procedure medication, written aftercare instructions and your scheduled follow-up reviews. Anything not included is named in the estimate rather than discovered afterwards.'],
        ['q' => 'Can I pay in instalments?',
         'a' => 'Instalment options are available through third-party finance providers. Terms, eligibility and any interest are set by the provider, not the clinic, and are explained before you commit. See <a href="/cost-and-emi-options">cost, EMI and payment options</a>.'],
        ['q' => 'Does insurance cover hair restoration?',
         'a' => 'Not usually. Treatment for pattern hair loss is classed as cosmetic by Indian health insurers and is generally paid for privately. Reconstruction after burns, trauma or surgery is occasionally assessed differently — check directly with your insurer.'],
    ],
    'Safety, risk and results' => [
        ['q' => 'Who actually performs the procedure?',
         'a' => 'Dr. Nyra performs the extraction, site creation and placement personally. This is worth asking every clinic you visit — the answer varies far more than most patients expect, and in many clinics the doctor consults while technicians operate.'],
        ['q' => 'Do you guarantee results?',
         'a' => 'No, and no clinic honestly can. Outcomes vary between patients, not every graft survives, and hair that was not transplanted can continue to thin. We give realistic expectations before you book and document progress photographically so the result can be judged against a baseline rather than a memory.'],
        ['q' => 'What are the risks?',
         'a' => 'For surgery: swelling, tenderness, temporary numbness, folliculitis, donor-area marks, shock loss and uneven density. For injections: tenderness, redness, pinpoint marks and bruising. Full detail is on the risks and side effects page, and everything relevant to your case is discussed again on consent.'],
        ['q' => 'Why are there no before-and-after photos on some pages?',
         'a' => 'Because only consented, unedited photographs of our own patients, shot at the same angle and lighting, will go there. Borrowed or stock results are both a Google policy problem and a medical-advertising problem — and patients recognise them anyway. The galleries fill as consented cases reach their review points.'],
        ['q' => 'Are the reviews on this site real?',
         'a' => 'Any review shown is a real one, displayed as given. We do not pre-screen patients before asking for a review — that practice is prohibited by Google policy and by consumer-protection rules, quite apart from making the ratings meaningless.'],
    ],
    'Privacy and records' => [
        ['q' => 'What happens to my photographs?',
         'a' => 'Clinical photographs are kept on your medical record and used to assess your progress. They are never published, shared or used in marketing without your specific written consent, and consent can be withdrawn.'],
        ['q' => 'What do you do with the details I submit?',
         'a' => 'They are used only to contact you about your enquiry and arrange your consultation. They are not sold or passed to third parties for marketing.'],
        ['q' => 'Will the clinic discuss my treatment with anyone else?',
         'a' => 'No. Your treatment is confidential. If you would like a family member involved in discussions, tell the clinic and that is easily arranged.'],
    ],
    'Choosing a clinic' => [
        ['q' => 'What should I ask before choosing anywhere?',
         'a' => 'Who physically performs the extraction and placement, and whether they are a doctor. How the graft number was arrived at. What the price includes. How many patients the clinic runs in a day. And what happens at the twelve-month review if density is uneven. The answers separate clinics far more reliably than the price does.'],
        ['q' => 'Is a cheaper clinic a false economy?',
         'a' => 'Not automatically — but the cheapest quote is often the one with the highest graft count, which is not the same as the best value. A repair procedure costs considerably more than getting it right the first time, and some outcomes cannot be repaired at all.'],
        ['q' => 'Should I travel abroad for treatment?',
         'a' => 'It can look cheaper on the headline figure before travel and accommodation. The part people underestimate is follow-up: hair restoration is judged over twelve months, with reviews along the way, and a complication three weeks later is much harder to manage from another country.'],
